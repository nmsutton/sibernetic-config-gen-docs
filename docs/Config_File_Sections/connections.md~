# Elastic Connections Section

[connection] - contains information about elastic connection of all elastic particles
<br>a b c d
<br>
<br>where:
<br>a = particle_j
<br>b = r_ij
<br>c = val1
<br>d = val2

particle_j = ID of particle .  ID is an index for the particles

r_ij = distance * Const.simulationScale
where distance is the distance between particle i and j .

val1 and val2 are values that effect the amount of elastic connection
created.

Note: details here derived from [main.py](https://github.com/openworm/sibernetic_config_gen/blob/master/main.py).
